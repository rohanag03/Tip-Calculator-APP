# Tip-Calculator-APP
I am following the [Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course) pathway and I have created this app.

Here I have a Tip Calculating APP that takes an user input for the costbof service and calcuates the tip based on the option to choose the percentage they want to tip.
User can also choose to round up the tip amount.

I also created this app optimised according to the dark theme.
